## Description: 
This week I was challenged to create a functioning command-line application from scratch, allowing interaction with staff's data that is stored in the company's database. Making it more accessible and user-friendly for non-development internal use. I've built this application using: Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation:
1. Clone the file from the GitHub to your local machine.

2. Once opened, run 'npm i' to install required dependencies.

3. Initialize & select database.

4. Run 'node index.js' command.

5. Navigate via menu's choices and make changes as neccesary.
